            	</div>
            	<p>I was born and raised in San Salvador, El Salvador where I went to a military school for "high school" (Bachillerato) where I also graduated as a paratrooper as being part of the Salvadorean Airborne course #131 (WWII training style). When I was 19 years old, I decided to try luck in Germany, where I lived and worked my first year as an Au-Pair. After finishing my 1-year-contract as an Au-Pair, I got enrolled at the <a href="https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/de" target="_blank">Hochschule Rhein-Waal</a> (Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences) where I graduated from International Business and Social Sciences. In the meantime, I also visited many countries all around Europe and lived in Tianjin, China for six months for my semester abroad. In 2013, I moved to Miami and enjoyed the tropical weather, but since 2015 I have been living in Austin,Tx, where I enjoy it very much. </p>
            	<p>I enjoy very much traveling, specially if it is more like backpacking or driving long distances. My favorite things to do are to play soccer, listen to rock music (All kind of genres and sub-genres), drive my motorcycle Aprilia Dorsoduro, and taste some very good different kind of beers (Of course not while driving my motorcycle)</p>
           		 <p>Currently, I am working as a contractor for Apple Maps in the German Speaking countries, and would like to improve my professional skills my learning so many things at this awesome Coding Bootcamp.
